| 9/13  |       4:15pm |       0:15 | read assignment and tried applying the rules on scratch paper                                                         |
| 9/13  |       4:30am |       1:00 | setup the main function and helpers print function out                                                                |
| 9/13  |       5:30pm |       0:30 | fixed any wrong outputs and learned how to better use header files                                                    |
| 9/13  |       7:00pm |       1:30 | coded up the logic for the life functions and added a new function called altered                                     |
| 9/13  |       8:30pm |       0:30 | the code worked for the first three cases but didn't work for others due to edge cases                                |
| 9/13  |       9:00pm |       0:15 | ran all the tests and added in value errors to consider (i.e., not equal size)                                        |

None.

# Discussion
To start, I had to look at what header files did and how they were actually implemented. I fiddled around with STATIC arrays and figured out how to initalize them. A lot of the time was focused on developing the logic on how to actually alter the cells without overriding past information (figured I could do this with two different static arrays). I also had major problems with edges cases and had to print out the logic to see what was happening. Additionally, had to incorporate and adjust the logic in my if statemetns in the alter function to correct for mistakes (i.e., converted cells that were alive to the new static array I created).
